<p>Not so hot on the heals of <a href="http://derivadow.com/">Tom Scott</a>'s <a href="http://derivadow.com/2011/07/30/our-manifesto/">development manifesto</a> for the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature">BBC Nature site</a> I thought I'd dig out the old <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes">BBC Programmes</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/programmes">@programmes</a>) manifesto. It took a while to track down but eventually turned up in a dusty folder with the title dogma.html...</p>
<p>The timestamp says 14/10/2008 but I think it existed as some post-it notes on a wall several months before that. I know it predated <a href="http://moustaki.org">Yves</a>' arrival, so also predated any of the Linked Data work. Which was really just a logical extension rather than any new principles. Anyway, here it is:</p>
<p>/programmes believes:</p>
<ol>
<li>in one web</li>
<li>in accessibility for people</li>
<li>in accessibility for machines</li>
<li>it's a service, not a product</li>
<li>in designing from the domain model up, not the interface down</li>
<li>in being RESTful</li>
<li>in open standards</li>
<li>in open data</li>
<li>in linked data</li>
<li>in fixing the data, not hacking the code</li>
<li>in links before pages</li>
<li>that the real value is in the links to other domains</li>
<li>in designing for the browser in the browser</li>
</ol>
<p>Like Tom's list we didn't always live up to these standards but they kept us (mainly) honest. I seem to remember we also kept a 'hack log' to keep track of anywhere we evaded our principles for the sake of expedience. Wonder what happened to that?</p>
