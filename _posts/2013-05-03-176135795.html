<p>Occasioned by someone describing media catalogue type data as the "crown jewels". It is not the crown jewels. It is, at best, a poster pointing out the attractions of the Tower of London.</p>
<p>If any data deserves the description of crown jewels it's your customer relationship data.</p>
<p>But since Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google probably know more about your users / customers / audience / fan base than you do, you've probably already accidentally outsourced that anyway...</p>
