  content: 'I made bbc.heroku.com - a mobile-optimised schedules browser app thing.
    It uses /programmes data. Also Yves, Nick, Patrick and I made Music Bore, which
    won the music hackday a couple of years ago. It uses /progs and /music data. '

  content: Outside of proper BBC activities, Project Baird (http://projectbaird.com/)
    uses /programmes and, for one demo, /nature data to show hybrid broadcast/connected
    TV stuff, although some of it's been a little neglected of lateâ€¦

  content: I built a bookmarklet that enhanced library catalogue records (in COPAC
    - made of merged online catalogues of many major University, Specialist, and National
    Libraries in the UK and Ireland) which related to composers, with data from BBC
    Music pages. Unfortunately when the Music pages were relaunched in August 2011
    the RDF representations were removed, and so I had to stop using the BBC directly.
    However, some of the BBC data was cached in another resource ('MusicNet' - http://musicnet.mspace.fm/),
    and so I was able to use some of this data and continue to supply links to BBC
    Music and use composer pictures from BBC Music.Details at http://www.meanboyfriend.com/overdue_ideas/2011/07/compose-yourself/
    - see comments for details of what broke when RDF support withdrawn

  content: 'I work in the central digital team for Universal Music UK. I used to work
    in the BBC Music interactive team around the time you were building the BBC artist
    pages. We''ll be doing something very similar at Universal - canonical artist
    pages for 200+ artists and their releases, using MusicBrainz IDs, RDF data, HTML
    template pages. Incidentally, the project is being developed by Martyn Davies
    of SIx Two Productions, also a BBC Music alumni. We''re planning to link to BBC
    reviews from each artist and release pages. '
