excerpt: This post is a possibly ranty reaction to the recent Wireframes are dead,
  long live rapid prototyping post on UX for the masses. If you've not read it, it's
  definitely worth a click. And also worth working your way through the comments it
  generate...

  content: Or in summary (perhaps) - wireframes &amp; visual designs will always suffer
    from the fact that they are isolated, static documents. Personally I think there's
    some utility to them in terms of conveying the general idea of various parts of
    a website, but what worries me from designs/wireframes I've seen recently is the
    lack of annotation and/or context. And there's only so much annotation you can
    place on a static document before it becomes incomprehensible. With such static
    documents, the links &amp; complexity ate implicit or hidden, and rely on you
    being able to communicate what actually happens in other ways, disconnected from
    the document - unless you want to create thousands of documents for the many complex
    cases.

  content: Prototyping isn't about code, it's about communication. Wireframes do lack
    the possibility to communicate interactions, something that prototypes can do
    well. It's about rapid iterations of design so that the techies, designers, stakeholders
    and users can all agree on what to build, to be confident that the solution will
    solve the problem, whatever it is.I get the point to build real stuff and test
    with real data and users, that's obviously something yo have to do as well, but
    why rush to the coding when you  don't know what to build?

  content: 'Samuel, I''m baffled. What do you think code is about if not communication?
    Prototypes might communicate interactions better than wireframes but not nearly
    so well as real code with real data and real content and real users. Code is as
    good a place as any to design and solve problems. When we''re talking about the
    web it''s the best place. There''s no spec on earth that doesn''t need to change
    the minute code hits data hits content hits users. I guess this is all an extension
    of the usual UCD vs agile debate. My take: UCD has had it''s day; agile has won
    that war. And it''s won it because it doesn''t just pay lip service to &quot;user
    centric&quot; whilst hiding away in a design studio with process documents for
    6 months.'

  content: It's all about finding the right level and if you are skilled enough to
    produce a design in real code as fast as you do with a prototyping tool, then
    I'm all for it. In my reality though, when iterating through your designs, you
    just don't have the time to code it all, so you use prototyping tools on the way
    to find the best solution.There's no contradiction between UCD and agile and of
    course you need to prepare for change. A prototype isn't the final solution, but
    a common ground to communicate what problems are supposed to be solved. A good
    prototype (simulation is a far better word btw) reduces the need for changes based
    on misunderstanding extensively.At least that's my experience.

  content: Hi SamuelI guess then we're agreeing to differ. I just don't think wireframes
    (whether omnigraffle style or developed through a rapid prototyping tool) allow
    you to ask and get answered the difficult questions that are important to user
    experience. Concentrating on the visible bits at the expense of the 90% of a modern
    web app that lives under the surface just feels like a mistake cos it's the 90%
    invisible bit that makes the most difference. If you don't get that right your
    UX is just lipstick painting on pigs.So is your markup semi sane? Is it search
    bot friendly? Does it work in a screen reader? Any screen reader? Are you using
    AJAX? What happens when j/s is turned off? Does the site degrade gracefully? Or
    are you taking a progressive enhancement approach? Or does it break? Is your site
    crawlable with j/s off? Are you pulling in data from other sites (a twitter feed
    eg)? What happens if twitter's down? Does the include degrade? To what? What's
    you page weight? How smooth is your page rendering? What's the page load time?
    How persistent are your URLs? Do you have a search sitemap? One for mobile? Do
    they work? How is your content licenced? Is it possible to embed it off site /
    syndicate it? What are your terms and conditions? What's your privacy policy?
    Do users own data submitted to your site? Do you make feeds available? Have an
    API? What's your caching strategy? Particularly http caching? Particularly for
    mobile? How does your site work across browsers? Across devices?The other problem
    is web sites aren't CD-ROMs. They don't exist in isolation. They are not complete
    in and of themselves. Web design isn't about making an isolated product. A web
    site has be designed to sit in the ecosystem of the web. So how does it play with
    Google? With Bing? With Twitter? With Facebook? What if you're replacing an existing
    site? Have you got a redirect plan? Using the appropriate http codes?Wireframes
    won't answer any of those question. Nothing but real live code will.

  content: I don't really see how code can help with licensing, terms and conditions
    or privacy questions, but other than that, what you mention is mostly technical
    requirements that obviously need to be developed and tested. I don't question
    that.My point with using simulations is not to solve these problems, but to figure
    out if the Twitter integration is needed or not in the first place. It helps finding
    the right requirements, and sets the right expectations early for all involved.But
    if it works for you and your team to jump it to code directly, you should do it.
    There's no single solution for all projects.

  content: I agree it does seem preposterous to invest time in learning increasingly
    complex prototyping tools, which only result in throwaway deliverables. Better
    perhaps to spend that time learning, as you suggest, real client-side markup and
    even Ruby etc. so that prototypes are the first iteration of real applications,
    rather than a smoke and mirrors show. Right now, there's a skills gap and UX people
    who are good at making interactions intuitive, aren't necessarily skilled developers
    and so are understandably drawn to empowering WYSIWYG tools with a lower learning
    curve. Maybe this will evolve over time. I also feel that if your site is essentially
    a one-way content repository, then evaluating it through its layout (i.e. via
    wireframes etc.) puts the emphasis on the wrong thing, leading (in my experience)
    to client squabbles over box placement when really the focus should be on a decent
    content strategy.But while I take your point about you wanting to control your
    own stylesheet, and that's fair enough, it isn't the be-all end-all of UX, on
    the web or any platform. Yes, on the kind of resource- and data-join-centric products
    we make, certainly most of the heavy lifting is going on beneath the presentation
    layer. But what if you were designing Mint.com, or Flickr, or Google Docs? There's
    got to be some particular skill in designing an interface that maximises task
    time and minimises tool time, and that's typically the purview of UX, and probably
    a good use case for rapid prototyping.

  content: "@samuel - Just to be clear (which I don't think I have been) I'm not saying
    jump straight to code. I am saying that for every standard UX deliverable there
    is a code equivalent in the web stack. And because that code is specifically written
    to describe that functionality it's better at it than pictures and natural language.
    At least in my opinion. So working with markup and CSS will give more accurate
    results than wireframes or prototyping tools. A routes file describing the URL
    structure and mapping it to controllers / actions is a better site map than a
    site map. Unit and functional tests are better at describing functional requirements
    than standard spec documents. And you can use tools like cucumber to write your
    spec and it'll automagically output tests.The problem at the moment is the functionality
    is defined in one set of formats by UX people, then translated into another set
    of formats by developers. Which to my mind is wasteful. And often leads to stuff
    getting lost in translation. The more we can close the gap between developers
    and UX and make UX deliverables a proper part of the development process and not
    just some paperwork the better. And prototyping tools don't help to close this
    gap.Also on the projects I work on we don't start with code. We start with a domain
    model which is the only real &quot;artifact&quot; we ever create. Obviously neither
    the domain model nor the code will write your privacy policy for you but they
    will, in my experience, raise the interesting and difficult questions far earlier
    than any standard UX deliverable. There's more on how we work &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radiolabs/2009/01/how_we_make_websites.shtml&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.Just
    as an example if your site has registered users and those users can comment there
    are immediate questions of whether and how those comments are moderated, whether
    the user can choose who can see them and whether the user can update or delete
    those comments. I've never seen UX deliverables surface these issues as early
    or clearly.@mike - Totally agree about the skills gap. Or maybe it's more of an
    understanding gap / language barrier? I wonder if something like the Rails for
    journalists meetups that happen would be useful for UX people too?Also agree that
    there's real skill in designing interfaces to minimise task time. Just think the
    duplication of effort (wireframes and CSS) means there's less UX time spent where
    it should be spentAnd to be double clear. None of this is intended as a criticism
    of UX people. I am a UX person. Just a comment on the redundancy (and lack of
    resolution) of many UX deliverables and a hope that joining up UX with development
    would remove duplication, make things more efficient and make UX deliverables
    more accurate to real world use."

  content: "@samuel - Sorry, one final point. The stuff I mentioned earlier is not
    &quot;technical requirements&quot;. It's a list of user experience questions.
    Every issue listed will affect how users experience your site. If we want to be

  content: I think you raise some interesting points. There's definitely wastefulness
    and in some organisation there are barriers to getting stuff built quickly and
    testing in the real world. The skills gap you guys have identified is a frustration
    for me. I think there's also a real lack of experimentation about how teams in
    organisations (at least the ones I've worked in) go about designing/building stuff.
    Most web/digital companies I've worked for have very siloed teams. They are allocated
    as 'resources' and the process becomes very linear and structured. Hence Agile
    ends up looking like mini-waterfalls.I wonder if a kind of pair programming might
    work where you take a talented developer and a UX person and sit at a desk and
    give them water and some shade. Or any other more collaborative process where
    skills cross over and where the whole thing is less structured. I imagine this
    kind of thing must happen in an informal way at startups and possibly teams that
    are more off-radar in large organisations.

    together quickly. When I worked at a great metropolitan web agency a few years
    back, they had a spiffing wheeze of teaming an IA and a VD (ironically, given
    this post, to produce visual mockups) which I felt worked really well to de-silo
    skills. Sadly it didn't catch on."

  content: Just a final comment... Again, I think communication is key, and I've found
    simulations to be really efficient both when communicating with the business,
    with developers and when testing it on end users. That secures that we design
    something that solves the business problems, works for the users and is technically
    feasible.From your link I read &quot;This should be clear from the business requirements&quot;
    and that's what the above usually is for in the projects I'm in.When it comes
    to the output from that work, the next challenge is to find the right deliverables
    of it and I guess it's here that the problem arises... But at least by now everyone
    has agreed on  what to build so the developers can focus on solving the issues
    with SEO, page load times etc instead of re-coding the entire application because
    &quot;that's not what we meant&quot;.I was previously a web developer, so I know
    the challenges and using simulations to find the right requirements really has
    saved me LOTS of time. But hey, whatever works for you...

  content: "@paul - Sorry mate. Completely missed your comment. But basically yes.
    Wireframes for the web don't work cos they don't use web standards. They don't
    use document standards (HTML, CSS, Javascript) so they don't tell you how the
    page will actually render in the real world on multiple browsers / devices. And
    they don't use linking standards (HTTP and URIs) so you have to overload the documents
    with context which makes them confusing. Prototyping tools try to solve some of
    this by making wireframes clickable but that only gives you a slightly more accurate
    of how your site links together and not how it fits into the wider web.@andy -
    Totally agree. Which is why I wonder if Rails for UX people (or something similar)
    would be useful. Anyway, I think the more differently talented people you can
    get working together on designing and building something the easier it becomes
    to solve real problems. When we started /programmes we had an IA, software engineers
    and designer all working together, all grappling with the same problems at the
    same time and all helping each other. It worked well and by the end it became
    difficult to tell where the SE stopped and the designer started and the IA stopped
    and the SE started and etc.But I think you point to a wider problem that the UX
    agency approach doesn't work cos it silos talent. The trouble is many of the 'UX
    superstars' come from design agency backgrounds and bring the talent split mentality
    with them. User experience on the web is holistic and needs lots of different
    people with lots of different skills to pull it off. The UX / dev split will always
    lead to inefficiencies and thinking that gets lost in translation. I think the
    real key is getting past multi-disciplinary working to having &quot;T-shaped people&quot;.
    But multi-disciplinary working is the obvious way to get to that point@samuel
    - So obviously business requirements evolve over time. You can take two approaches
    to that: stick with the UX process and get sign off on documentation before building
    or accept changes happen and go agile. The wider point is business requirements
    don't change in isolation. They usually change because of outside influences like
    some innovation a competitor has made. Signing off on documentation is gonna stop
    scope creep but I know from experience that it won't lead to the making of better
    things.In terms of business requirements all you really need to know is what domain
    you're working in. The UX process is designed to flesh out the details, ask the
    right questions, work through the issues etc. All I'm saying is that that splitting
    that process from development is wrong. And, imo, getting devs, designers, product
    managers etc to engage together, from the start, in designing the domain model
    is a better approach.As I said to andy, UX is holistic. It takes lots of different
    talents to make a good UX. And UX professionals don't have all those talents.
    And neither do software engineers. And neither do product managers.An example
    I've faced in the past: the UX people design wireframes for a given list view.
    The wireframes are fine. They get 'tested' with users who think they're fine.
    They get handed over to the dev team who also think they're fine. But unfortunately
    they don't think they're buildable. Or maybe they are buildable but the query
    required to build them is so complex the page would take 10 secs to load. And
    you can't cache it cos it's personalised. So you end up going back thru the circle
    again. I just think that's wasteful and getting talented devs and designers together
    from the start makes things easier. Any UX person or group of UX people who think
    they're solely responsible for the user experience of a site are wrong."

    for an agency where quality is key to the client relationship;2.  works for a

    for a brick and mortar where the web is just another way to promote a product,

    think this debate is interesting -- mostly for the difference in where points

<p>This post is a possibly ranty reaction to the recent <a href="http://www.uxforthemasses.com/rapid-prototyping/">Wireframes are dead, long live rapid prototyping</a> post on <a href="http://www.uxforthemasses.com/">UX for the masses</a>. If you've not read it, it's definitely worth a click. And also worth working your way through the comments it generated. As the title makes clear the post argues that wireframes, a traditional tool of the 'UX professional', no longer add value. I'd agree with this and probably go further and say they never have. And probably go further still and say none of the accepted 'UX Deliverables' (sitemaps, user journeys, card sorts (you're not building a library; this is the web; things don't have places) etc) add value either. And don't even get me started on 'Personas'...</p>
<p>But I disagree with the post on two counts. First off the 'Why ditch wireframes?' section lists six reasons why wireframes don't help you actually make stuff. I'd agree with all six but think they're not the most important reasons why wireframes suck. And secondly:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote"><p>the alternative is to bypass wireframes altogether and either go straight from sketch / outline designs to developing working code (in an Agile fashion), or as is more use common use [sic] a rapid prototyping tool to create a prototype</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which loses me at the comma. Because rapid protyping tools suck too. And, being harder to use than Omingraffle / fag packets + pencil, suck worse than wireframes.</p>
<h2>If wireframes aren't dead I'd be more than happy to take them outside and put a bullet through their head</h2>
<p>It's probably best to consider this list a personal addendum to the six reasons to ditch wireframes list in the original post.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>'UX professionals' seem to be obsessed with defining <em>optimum</em> user experience. Which is fine if you're making a poster or a magazine or a twonkPad app. But mostly we're talking about the web. And if I want / need to overwrite your CSS (because you've not designed for colour blind users (again!)) I will do. And if I want / need to increase your font size (because I'm getting older and my eyesight isn't as good as it was) I will do. And if I care about my privacy and want to ban your cookies I will do. And if I don't trust your javascript and want to stop it running I will do. And if my eyes really give out and I need to use a screen reader...</p>
<p>On a more basic level if I want to resize my browser I will do. And if your wireframes say the search form is top right what happens? Is your layout absolute so the search form disappears somewhere out of view or is your layout liquid making the search form always visible? CSS makes this behaviour explicit, wireframes don't.</p>
<p>The point is user experience on the web is up to the user. It's not something you as a designer / publisher can define and control. Wireframes are just one way to fool yourself and / or your 'client'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wireframes conflate: the data / content / assets you need to build a resource with one specific representation of that resource with the visual layout of that representation with the document order of that representation. Breaking that apart:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Imagine you want to list some things. Imagine that list is time based with new items being added as some state somewhere changes. Do you want to make RSS of that list available? Or imagine it's a list of events. Do you want to make that list available as an ical / ics feed? From a less data centric point of view do you want to make a mobile friendly version of your page? A smart phone version? An iPad version? Then what is your wireframe supposed to represent? And are you going to make a different wireframe for every possible device that might at some point want to access your content?</p>
<p>The point is to document the data / services you need to build <em>all</em> representations of your resource, not just some simplified / idealised desktop HTML version. How best to do that? My advice would be over a coffee / beer with a developer on a fag packet. If god had intended us to specify data queries in plain Engish / French / whatever (s)he wouldn't have invented SQL or SPARQL. The best way to document code is in code. The rest is paperwork and process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second problem is more general and more common. Very roughly speaking (and for accessibility and SEO reasons) an HTML document should be: h1, content, navigation. For some 'stickiness' reason or some misguided belief that most visitors arrive through your homepage and have the patience to navigate your navigation, page layouts tend to stick 'global navigation' (for some definition of global) at the top of the page. Which is fine from a page presentation point of view. But a bit rubbish from a document design / SEO / accessibility point of view. Again, title, content, navigation. And use CSS to 'move' your navigation to the top of the 'page'. If god had intended us to specify page layout in pictures (s)he wouldn't have invented CSS.</p>
<p>Document design has nothing to do with visual layout (except by default with CSS off). Design your document first, then use CSS to add layout. For what it's worth I divide my CSS into two bits: layout.css handles the floats and the positions and the margins and the padding; decor.css handles the decorative stuff (colours, typefaces etc). Like it or loathe it, CSS is the design language of the web. If you want to wireframe stuff edit layout.css. Any other means of codifying layout is a lie and will catch up with you.</p>
</li>

<h2>If wireframes are dead, rapid prototyping tools should die in their arms</h2>
<p>So I don't really like wireframes. But I really dislike rapid prototyping tools. If you've not already read the comments on the original post it's probably worth doing so. They break down roughly into:</p>
<ol>
<li>wireframes are still useful as a deliverable / conversation tool with clients</li>
<li>suggestions for other rapid prototyping tools to use. From a quick scan through, suggestions are:  Axure, Balsamiq, EasyPrototype, iPoltz, InDesign, SketchFlow, Flowella, Justinmind Prototyper, LucidChart, Tiggr, Protoshare, Naview and Cacoo</li>
</ol>
<p>How in god's name did so many people make so many tools that pretend to make websites when making websites isn't that hard? The problem is all these tools output wireframes with links. Sometimes they do that by outputting HTML and CSS and a few annotations. But even then they do it badly. Which is almost forgiveable: even people employed to make HTML and CSS often do it badly; the machines never stood a chance. But they have all the problems of wireframes (conflation of resource and representation, document and layout) without the benefit of being easy to ammend and update. Really, stick to pencils and fag packets and working code.</p>
<p>One final rant: Designing how code interacts with idealised data is easy. But you're never going to know how your application works until you combine real code with real data with real users. You can wrap your process in as many "user centric" buzzwords as you like but until you're testing real code with real data with real users the picture will be, at best, fuzzy. Or ship, test, change. And realise UX deliverables are fine as project checkpoints and fine as signifiers to client X that this might be a good point to donate to your bank account but they're really only of benefit to your agency / bank manager / random important person incapable of abstract thought, and they really won't lead to the things you're making being any better / the making of better things.</p>
