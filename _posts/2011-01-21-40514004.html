  content: 'Turning the first broadcast into a time-based event via social media just
    amplifies the marketing push. OK, effectively it''s a push to bittorrent as well
    (as you say)... but its also audible round the rest of the world, raising anticipation
    for, eg, UK audiences waiting for new Glee eps to hit C4. I bet you 5p that Glee''s
    event-based success in America won''t push their UK viewing figs / DVD / commercial
    stream sales down. *Yet*. I guess that''s yr point. What''s the analogy with film
    releases, M Sm? Cinema ticket sales are *up* aren''t they - despite the fact that
    your gloom re staggered global release, internet buzz + bit torrent all apply
    to films as well. Maybe eventification of first TX is, for global TV shows, the
    equiv to the big-screen experience for films: A reason to wait to see it here
    w yr own friends + follows. Meanwhile, someone somewhere is working out how to
    do global, all-territory, simultaneous release via the web - because they''ll
    have to. Colour me Pangloss, but wouldn''t that be *great*?  Like the guy says,
    It''s easy: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dyswe_XY8LY'

  content: 'Hi FaithI think it''s most cruel of you to pick on one point, stated as
    conjecture, just because you know me well enough to know it was the only point
    I was interested in making :-)The cinema ticket sales point is interesting but
    I don''t think it''s a direct analogy for TV. Cinemas are in the business of selling
    experience as much as content. A trip to the cinema is still a (fairly) cheap
    night out. And the difference in experience between  a film watched in a cinema
    and the same film watched on TV (even on a gazillion inch, HD, 3D TV) is huge.
    It''s not quite the same as the difference between live music and buying a CD
    but it has similarities. And the difference between watching a film on TV and
    a film via bit torrent is not so huge...The film industry also has other problems.
    They''ve tended to test screen by releasing something like a beta of a film, gauging
    audience reaction and recutting. Also producing film stock is expensive so US
    produced films will tend to air first in the US, then the same film will be exported
    to other territories when US cinemas have finished with them. The other big problem
    is that different territories / jurisdictions have different certification / classification
    systems so films are often recut to maximise potential audiences with the best
    possible classification.That said, film studios &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; attempting
    to move away from this. For the real, proper, massive blockbusters (a new Star
    Wars eg) they now release simultaneously across territories. And DVD lead times
    are also decreasing in another attempt to combat potential &quot;piracy&quot;.
    Also I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; the BBC and BBC Worldwide ran the last series
    of Doctor Who as a UK / USA simulcast for the same reasons?!?On your point about
    social media raising anticipation globally... There''s anticipation and there''s
    anticipation. Waiting two weeks is one thing, waiting six months quite another.
    The music industry has already been through this and realised that marketing (via
    social media or otherwise) to people who can''t legally get the content you''re
    marketing is only going to make those people get it through another means. Their
    first tactic was an attempt to reinforce their existing business models in code
    and stick DRM on everything. Which ends up turning what should be content businesses
    into content protection businesses. And doesn''t work. It took the intervention
    of Apple to change that.And I''ll take your 5p bet in the medium / long term.
    I reckon territorial release models and the resulting piracy will drive down TV
    resale values given time.On your comment &quot;Maybe eventification of first TX
    is, for global TV shows, the equiv to the big-screen experience for films: A reason
    to wait to see it here w yr own friends + follows.&quot; that''s just the point.
    Many of my friends and followees are not in the UK. They &quot;promote&quot; stuff
    I''m not legally allowed to see. Which is just annoying for what is basically
    some 1s and 0s.Finally: &quot;Meanwhile, someone somewhere is working out how
    to do global, all-territory, simultaneous release via the web - because they''ll
    have to.&quot; Do you really think they are? It''s not something I''ve heard anyone
    talking about (not that I would but stuff does tend to leak). As it stands I hear
    some talk about insane complexity around managing territorial release on a VOD
    product and occasional talk of the need for DRM on the HTML5 video element and
    various other sounds of stable doors being bolted.I think this is all probably
    more difficult for the broadcast business than it was for the music industry and
    it will be for the film industry because music companies and film studios are
    already global businesses. Whereas broadcasters are licenced to &quot;broadcast&quot;
    in a given territory / jurisdiction. (Some of them are even funded by a licence
    for a specific jurisdiction....)I think like you it has to happen but suspect
    it will take something similar to Apple''s intervention in the music industry
    (with traditional content producers splitting off from traditional distributors)
    before it becomes a reality. And I don''t think broadcasters are ready to work
    on the problem together. As I tweeted to our mutual boss most organisations when
    confronted with the web ask &quot;how can we make our website better&quot; rather
    than &quot;how can we ensure we still have a business&quot;.That said, if it is
    happening I''d love to know because without it all our Monday-Friday 9-5 work
    (Linked Data, clips on programmes, social media, making simple bloody suppers
    show up in Google) is imo worthless in the long term... :-/'

<p>Lots of people in my Twitter world spent yesterday pointing at a Read Write Web post on <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/what_glee_means_for_twitter_television.php">What Glee Means for Twitter &amp; Television</a>. It's all familiarish stuff around second screen social media:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote"><p>Twitter is becoming a side dish for prime time entertainment and, as the networks catch on, it's becoming a tool for bringing the audience back from the land of DVRs and time-shifted television into real-time viewing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The hook for the article is the use of social media by the programme producers so:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote"><p>The characters on Glee actually tweet and they tweet during the show. When Glee starts, the moment it airs for the first time on the East Coast, the tweets per second for Glee shoot up. They stay up there at a super high level at hundreds of [times] what they are before the show comes on until the moment the show ends and then they drop. [...] People feel like they have to watch the show while it's going on because the community is tweeting about the show and the characters are tweeting as the show's happening so [they have to] watch it in real time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is interesting for TV production (although I guess radio presenters have been presenting and tweeting for quite a while). But it wasn't really the technique that caught my eye. Lots of people in TV spend lots of time talking about "event television" and "watercooler moments" (sorry). The PVR and catch-up services like iPlayer shifted the emphasis away from the broadcast and up to the episode as the thing that people talked about / pointed at etc. And now social media seems to be shifting the balance back toward the broadcast. Which makes it slightly less about the thing you've watched and slightly more about when you've watched it. Twitter etc allow for distributed communal viewing and make the "watercooler moment" (again sorry) and the broadcast moment one and the same.</p>
<p>From a broadcaster's point of view this is obviously good news because up until the closing credits of the first broadcast the broadcaster retains complete control. And once someone records to their PVR they lose at least partial control. Once a programme's recorded they can fast forward through advertising breaks which, for a mainly advertising funded medium, is a bit of a pain. And part of the reason I guess why <a href="http://www.out-law.com/page-11701">product placement will be permitted on UK TV from next month</a>.</p>
<p>The PVR argument is the usual one given for why the broadcast moment is still important to broadcasters. But there's more to post-broadcast loss of control than PVRs. Past the first broadcast there are obviously repeats and DVDs and box sets. But there's also bit torrent and a generation growing up who've grown used to asking for content and getting it. And once content is out in the wild and easily digitised and easily duplicated and easily distributed by a web which is world wide...</p>
<p>All of this is a particular problem for the broadcast industry which is still very much based around territorial releases. Glee for example debuted in the US in May 2009, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glee_(TV_series)#International_broadcasters">didn't arrive in Australia until September 2009</a>. Social media might be useful as a means to switch people  away from on demand and back to broadcast. But for all the problems it might solve it only exasperates others. Because the people you friend / follow / whatever on social media services aren't restricted to those who happen to live within reach of the same transmitter tower as you. Which means if you're in Australia you might be getting Glee spoilers four months before you're (legally) able to watch it. Or you could wait a couple of hours and just take the less legal route. Seeing social media as a handy way to expose your "product" is fine if you can control who it's exposed to and make sure there's some correlation between the exposees and the availability. But social media is web scale and global; the broadcast business model isn't.</p>
<p>Back in the day the music industry had similar problems with territorial releases timed to coincide with tours (and associated TV and radio interviews). But given time (and the intervention of Apple) they were able to adapt to a more connected world. That said it was easier for them; the record labels (or the major ones at least) often owned the publishing rights. The relationship between producers / distributors and rights holders in the broadcast industry isn't quite so cosy.</p>
<p>Anyway, all of this made me wonder what changes about "event television" when events start to be shared internationally rather than nationally / regionally. And whether social media is starting to change the definition of "event television".</p>
<p>In the past (and in the main) event television has tended to be more about programmes with a short shelf life (or rather programmes with content with a short shelf life). Match of the Day feels like an obvious example. If you watch on a Saturday night (and you haven't peeked at the sports results on the news and you don't have Sky) the content is relevant. If you catch the repeat on a Sunday (by which point you've probably read a paper or listened to the radio or checked a website) it's slightly less relevant. By the following Saturday it's relevance is pretty much zero. Obviously it still has historical value and if it's the episode where your team beat the local rival 7-0 it probably has value to you and fellow fans. But it's not going to be repeated at Christmas or rebroadcast on Dave or released on DVD.</p>
<p>So different programmes have different shelf lives. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qpgr/products">The Archers has audio books</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0070hz6">606</a> doesn't; <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mj59/products">Top Gear has DVDs</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006ppmq">Crimewatch</a> doesn't. Some content retains it's value well past first broadcast but that's the same content that retains its value when delivered via less legal routes. And it feels like that's the content that broadcasters should be working hard to get to audiences at first broadcast. But most of the social media effort seems to go toward more obvious targets; the kind of programmes that have always been focussed on audience feedback whether via the postbag or the phone or email. Which tend to be the kind of programmes whose shelf life is shortest. It might make for better programmes but it isn't about tempting audiences back toward broadcast before the content "escapes".</p>
<p>Glee is different. It's classic long shelf life content. It's been syndicated to numerous countries. It's available on DVD. I dare say it's available all over bit torrent. So the fact that the producers are using social media to tempt people back toward first broadcast is interesting. Because it isn't about a big media company using social media as another source of "<a href="http://derivadow.com/2008/11/07/ugc-its-rude-its-wrong-and-it-misses-the-point/">user generated content</a>" or a simple promotional channel; they're promoting the event, not the product.</p>
<p>I get the feeling that if a British broadcaster attempted to do what the producers of Glee are doing they'd pick on a Coronation Street or an Eastenders. But soaps, like phone-ins, are short shelf life. Given that broadcasters are spending money on social media and given that the pot of money to do that is limited I'm thinking the best place to spend that money is on long shelf life content rather than phone ins?</p>
