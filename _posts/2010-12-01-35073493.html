  content: Ahh, thanks Michael. That makes a lot more sense the way you've described
    it here :-) This is a large graph visualization problem right? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stanford.edu/~dgleich/&quot;&gt;David
    Gleich&lt;/a&gt; and his group at Stanford did some &lt;a href=&quot;http://cads.stanford.edu/lcshgalaxy/explore.html&quot;&gt;graph
    visualization&lt;/a&gt; of the relations between subjects in the Library of Congress
    Subject Headings, where there were (if I remember right) ~100K nodes. But this
    sort of visualization for all of dbpedia (millions of nodes) would be way beyond
    that. It's definitely beyond my capabilities...but I'll ping David in Twitter
    cc'ing you to see if he has any ideas.

<p>DBpedia is often described as a Linked Data hub. Its <a href="http://dbpedia.org/About">about page</a> even describes it as a Nucleus for the Web of Data. A glance at the <a href="http://richard.cyganiak.de/2007/10/lod/">LOD cloud diagram</a> shows DBpedia front and centre with <em>lots</em> of datasets pointing in.</p>
<p>The implication is if you have some book data and I have some book data, we can both link to DBpedia as a central identifier hub and it becomes possible to triangulate between our datasets. Which is fine. At least if the identifiers don't <a href="http://fantasticlife.posterous.com/linked-data-website-as-api-and-uri-fragility">wobble</a>.</p>
<p>But I wonder what happens if you have some book data and I have some music data or you have some health data and I have some nutrition data etc. DBpedia has data from lots of different domains. By showing it as a single bubble on the LOD cloud it's <em>implied</em> that it's internally coherent, heavily interlinked and homogenous. I wonder if that's true.</p>
<p>Lots of people have looked at the link density within Wikipedia but DBpedia relationships are only the subset it's possible to auto extract (mainly infoboxes and categories). And most of the links within Wikipedia are inline in the article text. So how interlinked is that subset of Wikipedia links. Would it be possible to follow your nose across domains from punk to the Sex Pistols to Jamie Reid to the Situationists like you can in Wikipedia for example? Or not?</p>
<p>Or if you made a diagram similar to the LOD one but only depicting link density <em>inside</em> DBpedia would it look like an homogenous data space or more like a microcosm of the LOD cloud with lots of sparsely connected islands. Is it a hub or a set of hubs that happens to be extracted from the same source and hosted in the same place? If it's the latter it kinda implies that we don't have one Linked Data cloud but several?!?</p>
